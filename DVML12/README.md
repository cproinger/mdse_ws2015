0) create a github account if you don't already have one. you should use a new workspace so your local project is not in conflict with this one.
1) to clone the repo copy https://github.com/cproinger/mdse_ws2015.git to your clipboard, go into eclipses git perspective and click the "clone a git repository", the opening dialog should look like this after you entered your authentication.



2) click next. master branch is selected. click next.
3) select a location destination for the repository and click next and then finish



4) your git-repositories view should look like this now. as you can see. DVML12 is a Subfolder of the repository you just cloned. i also ignored the src-folder of the project as well as the generated projects because they don't need to be modified from their generated form by now.



5) right klick on DVML12, select "Import Projects ..." -> Next -> Finish
6) DVML12 is now imported but you will have errors from your manifest-file. Generate All from genmodel now so deal with them.
